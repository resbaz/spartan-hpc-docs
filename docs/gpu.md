Spartan hosts a GPGPU service, developed in conjunction with Research Platform Services, the Melbourne School of Engineering, Melbourne Bioinformatics, RMIT, La Trobe University and Deakin University. It was funded through [ARC LIEF](http://www.arc.gov.au/linkage-infrastructure-equipment-and-facilities) grant LE170100200.

It consists of 72 nodes, each with four NVIDIA P100 graphics cards, which can provide a theoretical maximum of around 900 teraflops.  These nodes will be presented in 3 subclusters and will be released in stages.  The first subcluster consisting of 28 nodes is available immediately.  The remaining subclusters will come online as demand increases.


## Access
The GPGPU cluster is available to University researchers, as well as external institutions that partnered through the ARC LIEF grant.

Those with existing Spartan accounts will need to create a new project dedicated to GPGPU use. Data can still be transferred from existing projects, but an independent GPGPU project is required for accounting purposes. 

Those new to Spartan can signup for a user account at [https://dashboard.hpc.unimelb.edu.au/karaage/](https://dashboard.hpc.unimelb.edu.au/karaage/), as well as request a new project (or access to an existing one).


## Usage

The GPGPU cluster operates as per other Spartan partitions, and so the documentation on this page can be followed with respect to logging in, accessing software, and creating job scripts.

To request one or more GPGPUs in your job script, see: [https://dashboard.hpc.unimelb.edu.au/faq/#how-do-i-get-access-to-gpus](https://dashboard.hpc.unimelb.edu.au/faq/#how-do-i-get-access-to-gpus)
